// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences
//
// A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single spaceÂ with no leading or trailing spaces.
//
// You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single **sentence**.
//
// Return _the **maximum number of words** that appear in a single sentence_.
//
// **Example 1:**
//
// ```
// **Input:** sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", <u>"this is great thanks very much"</u>]
// **Output:** 6
// **Explanation:**
// - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
// - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
// - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
// Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
// ```
//
// **Example 2:**
//
// ```
// **Input:** sentences = ["please wait", <u>"continue to fight"</u>, <u>"continue to win"</u>]
// **Output:** 3
// **Explanation:** It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words.
// In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
// ```
//
// **Constraints:**
//
// *   `1 <= sentences.length <= 100`
// *   `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`
// *   `sentences[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.
// *   `sentences[i]` does not have leading or trailing spaces.
// *   All the words in `sentences[i]` are separated by a single space.
