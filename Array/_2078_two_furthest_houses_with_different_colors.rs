// https://leetcode.com/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors
//
// There are `n` houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `colors` of length `n`, where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `i<sup>th</sup>` house.
//
// Return _the **maximum** distance between **two** houses with **different** colors_.
//
// The distance between the `i<sup>th</sup>` and `j<sup>th</sup>` houses is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs(x)` is the **absolute value** of `x`.
//
// **Example 1:**
//
// ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/31/eg1.png)
// ```
// **Input:** colors = [<u>**1**</u>,1,1,**<u>6</u>**,1,1,1]
// **Output:** 3
// **Explanation:** In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
// The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
// House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6\. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
// Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.
// ```
//
// **Example 2:**
//
// ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/31/eg2.png)
// ```
// **Input:** colors = [<u>**1**</u>,8,3,8,<u>**3**</u>]
// **Output:** 4
// **Explanation:** In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
// The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
// House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3\. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.
// ```
//
// **Example 3:**
//
// ```
// **Input:** colors = [<u>**0**</u>,**<u>1</u>**]
// **Output:** 1
// **Explanation:** The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
// House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1\. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.
// ```
//
// **Constraints:**
//
// *   `n ==Â colors.length`
// *   `2 <= n <= 100`
// *   `0 <= colors[i] <= 100`
// *   Test data are generated such that **at least** two houses have different colors.
